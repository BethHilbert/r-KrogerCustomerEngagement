# Kroger Customer Engagement

To analyze how promotion affects future customer engagement. Customer engagement will be measured by subsequent purchases of the product. I am using R and a dataset provided by 84.51. November 2018. 

This project is in process and will be finished December 2018. 


Dataset
--------------------
I will use the Carbo_Loading dataset provided by 84.51. The [data](http://uc-r.github.io/data_wrangling/final-project) is a subset of 4 potentially related product commodities (pasta/sauce, pancake mix/syrup) including their sales and weekly promotion. Promotions are identified by location in flyer of ads, in-store display, and coupons. 



Process
--------------------
The original dataset includes 5,197,681 transactions, the grain is one row per household per UPC per day.  There are 927 products with their associated promotion campaigns (ads and in store displays) over a 2 year period.

Note: This is a different project than Kroger Case with which my team won the 84.51 Competition in September 2018. I cannot upload that project to Github as it was live data and proprietary information.
